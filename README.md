## Semi.vim

**A pluging to to insert semi colons at the end of a line.**

When in insert mode you hit ; it will append it to the end of a line, pressing
backspace will move it back to where is should have been put and everything else
should work like normal!

This is a clone of one of my favourite features in Eclipse's text editor, so I
have tried to emulate it in Vim!
